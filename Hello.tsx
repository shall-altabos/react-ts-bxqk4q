My best friend John who was also the best man at our weddingcould see I was eyeing her and he offered to introduce us. She was shy and didn’t say much whichadded to her charm. After the rally I asked her if she’d like to go the game together the next day.From there on we were inseparable. </p></div><div className="bcr-content"><h3>OUR WEDDING</h3><p>Family and friends still talk about our wedding and tell us all the time that it was one of the best weddings they've ever attended. </p></div><div className="bcr-content"><h3>OUR FONDEST MEMORY</h3><p>Charlie is a romantic.
